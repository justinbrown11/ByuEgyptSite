                The clustering in the scatterplot to the left and the 2D plot below revealed that the direction a mummy’s head was facing at death changed after a certain point. Depth in the cemetery is related to specimen age and the shallowest (most recent) specimens that were uncovered were only facing west. To be more precise, above the depth of .68 meters, no more mummies were buried facing East and there were over 20 records with their heads facing west.  This indicates that there was a point in time that mummies stopped being buried with a head direction of East and is a clear change in burial practices. The 3D model shows that there is a larger number of longer bodies (adults) facing direction 2 (East) than children, but the sample size is so small that it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding this observation.

            Above shows mummy depth and length with a third dimension showing if the mummy is an adult or a child. The data are also clustered and colored according to the status of child vs. adult where all blue points are adults and yellow points are children. The blue dots clustered closer to the top means they are longer than the children. The fact that the blue dots go closer to the top of the graph shows that adults were buried at a greater depth, meaning the specimen is older.

            In simple terms, we came to the conclusion that 1) most of the older mummies were adults and 2) in general, adults have greater lengths than children. In the more distant past, it is possible that kids were buried somewhere besides the cemetery or in a different way. It is also possible that they were not wrapped and that as a result, all burial evidence has since disintegrated.

            Above is 2D visualization which makes it easier to see the correlation between depth and length. Depth is a representation of time so this visualization can be thought of as a timeline with 0 on the left representing more recent mummies and 2.5 on the right representing the more distant past. While the goal of this analysis is to identify burial patterns, it is also interesting to note that the maximum length (height) is relatively consistent over time. This means that adults were approximately the same height over the course of the time that this cemetery was in use.
