            The research team has a working hypothesis that the burial practices in the 1,000 year-old cemetery of Fag El-Gamous could have changed over time. While it is impossible to tell the full story, the data has opened the door to previously unknown insights regarding the the mummies of the Fag el-Gamous dig site.

        <h3 class="my-4">Main Conclusions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="lead">Head direction has changed over time. This is evidenced by the fact that the direction many mummies’ heads were facing changed at different depths. Depth corresponds to the year in which the mummy was buried--the older mummies are deeper and the newer mummies are shallower.</li>
            <li class="lead">In the distant past, kids were not buried in this area. It is only more recently that kids started being buried in this cemetery.</li>

    <h2>Head Direction and Depth</h2>

                The clustering in the scatterplot to the left and the 2D plot below revealed that the direction a mummy’s head was facing at death changed after a certain point. Depth in the cemetery is related to specimen age and the shallowest (most recent) specimens that were uncovered were only facing west. To be more precise, above the depth of .68 meters, no more mummies were buried facing East and there were over 20 records with their heads facing west.  This indicates that there was a point in time that mummies stopped being buried with a head direction of East and is a clear change in burial practices. The 3D model shows that there is a larger number of longer bodies (adults) facing direction 2 (East) than children, but the sample size is so small that it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding this observation.

<h2>Depth and Length</h2>

            The visualization to the left shows mummy depth and length with a third dimension showing if the mummy is an adult or a child. The data are also clustered and colored according to the status of child vs. adult where all blue points are adults and yellow points are children.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
                The fact that the blue dots are clustered closer to the top left of the visualization means that 1) the adult mummies are longer than the children and 2) there are several adult mummies buried at a greater depth than the deepest children. This means that in the more distant past, it is possible kids were buried somewhere besides the cemetery, or they were buried in a different way such that their remains were not preserved as well as their adult counterparts.

            Above is a 2D visualization which makes it easier to see the correlation between mummy burial depth and length. Depth is a representation of time so this visualization can be thought of as a timeline with 0 on the left representing more recent mummies and 2.5 on the right representing the more distant past. While the goal of this analysis is to identify burial patterns, it is also interesting to note that the maximum length (height) is relatively consistent over time. This means that adults were approximately the same height over the course of the time that this cemetery was in use.
